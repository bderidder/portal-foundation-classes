ANT project build properties
----------------------------

Copy the file sample-ant-user.props to your home folder. Rename it to ".ant-user.props".
Edit the file and adjust any paths as required. Windows users should write paths like "C:\myfolder\anotherfolder\".

Windows users: try to avoid spaces anywhere in the path !

TIP: if you want to deviate from the above, edit the following line in the build.xml file:

<property file="${user.home}/.ant-user.props" />


Registry File Location
----------------------

Copy the file Demo-registry.xml to a location somewhere on your computer or leave it here. Note the path where the file
is located and and edit the file WEB-INF/services/Registry-service.xml accordingly.

Windows users: write paths like C:\\folder\\Registries\\Demo-registry.xml
